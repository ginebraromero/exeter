                About DRAIN GANG
            </div>
            <p>Drain Gang (formerly known as Gravity Boys Shield Gang) is an artistic collective, focusing on music and
                fashion.</p><br>

                <p> The group formed in 2013 in Stockholm. Thaiboy Digital was residing in Sweden at the time. Bladee and
                Ecco2K had previously collaborated as the grindcore duo Krossad. Signing to the YEAR0001 label, the
                members of Drain Gang gained prominence in the cloud rap scene from their collaborations with labelmate
                Yung Lean.</p><br>
                <p>
                Speaking on the meaning of the group's name, Bladee states:</p><br>
                <p>
                #Drain is about loss and gain; it could be good or bad — you could be drained of energy or you could
                drain something to gain energy. There's financial, emotional and physical drains, for example — you
                could just be draining your bank account at the store. It doesn't have to be deep. Basically, if I'm
                talking about 'eating the night' that means I drain it for its essence. Everything me and my bros do is
                connected to that concept — we might drain some blood for good fortune.</p><br>
                <p>
                In 2015, Thaiboy Digital's visa expired and he was deported from Sweden. Through the internet, he has
                managed to continue collaborating with the other members from his new home in Bangkok. He and Bladee
                released a collaborative EP titled AvP in 2016, which featured production from both Whitearmor and Yung
                Sherman.</p><br>
                <p>
                In 2017, Bladee, Ecco2K and Thaiboy Digital released their collaborative album D&G, featuring production
                from member Whitearmor, and frequent collaborators Gud, Yung Sherman, Woesum, and Australian-based
                collective Ripsquadd.</p><br>
                <p>
                In 2019, the group released a collaborative EP titled Trash Island. Whitearmor served as the executive
                producer, while Ripsquadd and German producer Mechatok returned to contribute additional production. The
                EP was a surprise release, as no announcement was made on YEAR0001's nor the group's various social
                medias.</p><br>
                <p>
                In late 2021, the group announced a 2022 Drain Gang world tour, consisting of 23 performances across
                Europe and North America.</p><br>
                <p>
                In 2022, Bladee and Ecco2K released a collaborative single titled "Amygdala" produced by Mechatok.[9] A
                collaborative album by Bladee & Ecco2K, entitled Crest, was released unannounced in March of the same
                year. The album, containing the single "Girls just want to have fun", was produced entirely by
                Whitearmor.</p>
